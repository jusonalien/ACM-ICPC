# ACM-ICPC repository

Hi,this repository is made up of my templates codes used in ACM-ICPC,all of which have been judged to some online judges such as [HDU](http://acm.hdu.edu.cn/),[PKU Oj](http://poj.org/),[USACO](http://cerberus.delosent.com:791/usacogate) and so on,and all of them have gotten the results of "Accepted".

So wellcome to use these codes in your any competition~,
